Additive mixing: 

Red + Green = Yellow                           Red + Blue = Magenta    

Green + Blue = Cyan                        Red + Green + Blue = White


Subtracting Mixing: 

White has three colors Red, Green and Blue.
Red = White - Green – Blue
Green = White - Red – Blue
Blue = White - Green – Red (That means subtract green color and red color from white color).
Cyan = White - Red
Yellow = White - Blue
Magenta = White - Green
Black = White – Red – Green – Blue (That means no color exists).
